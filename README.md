# DevProjects

In this repository I'm uploading all (at least partially) finished dev projects.
Mostly to share them with friends but if you have got here by accident feel free to try one of my applications.

## Info

For some games, I'm using the Unity game engine and the Photon network engine for most of my projects. So have a look at [Unity's Privacy Policy](https://unity3d.com/de/legal/privacy-policy) as well as to [ExitGames' Privacy Policy](https://dashboard.photonengine.com/en-US/account/privacyandcookiepolicy) before running one of my Unity/Photon applications.
