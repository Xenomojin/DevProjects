# DevProjects

In this repository I'm uploading all (at least partially) finished dev projects.
Mostly to share them with friends but if you have got here by accident feel free to try one of my applications.

## Info

For some projects, I'm using the Unity game engine and the Photon network engine. So have a look at [Unity's Privacy Policy](https://unity3d.com/de/legal/privacy-policy) as well as at [ExitGames' Privacy Policy](https://dashboard.photonengine.com/en-US/account/privacyandcookiepolicy) before running one of my Unity/Photon applications.
